Task Description:
For the third task of my internship, I developed an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly in Python. The aim of this task was to visualize a dataset in a way that provides clear and actionable insights. I selected a sales dataset that included attributes such as order date, product category, region, sales, and profit. Before beginning the implementation, I studied the dataset carefully to understand the different variables and their relationships, which helped in deciding the types of visualizations that would be most effective.

To carry out this task, I referred to YouTube tutorials for practical guidance on setting up Dash applications and structuring interactive components. I also used quickref.me (https://quickref.me/) for quick syntax checks of Pandas and Plotly commands. For understanding how to design professional dashboards and arrange multiple plots, I referred to resources like GeeksforGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and Plotly’s official documentation (https://plotly.com/python/). Additionally, I went through several Google articles and blogs, including tutorials on Towards Data Science (https://towardsdatascience.com/), which helped me compare Dash with other dashboard tools such as Tableau and Power BI.

The dashboard I developed included a dropdown filter for selecting product categories, a time series line chart for tracking sales trends, a bar chart to show sales distribution by region, and a pie chart to visualize profit distribution across categories. The interactivity ensured that whenever a user changed the dropdown selection, all visualizations updated dynamically.

Through this task, I gained valuable experience in integrating Python with web-based dashboards, handling interactivity with callbacks, and designing layouts that communicate insights effectively. I also learned about the strengths of Dash — it is highly customizable and integrates seamlessly with Python libraries — compared to Tableau and Power BI, which are faster for drag-and-drop visualizations but less flexible for custom logic. Overall, this task strengthened my understanding of data visualization, interactive applications, and storytelling with data, which are crucial skills in data analysis and business intelligence.
